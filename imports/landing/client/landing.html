<h1>Welcome to Crosser</h1>

<p>Crosser is a program to explore plant breeding strategies. The user enters the donor plants and a crossing scheme, and Crosser calculates the proportion of the genome that comes from the recombinant parent, and the number of offspring that need to be tested to give a 95% chance of having 5 plants with the desired traits. </p>
<p>Crosser deals with averages, so the outputs are of the average situation. In real life, there is of course a range of possible outcomes around this.</p>

      <p>Crosser is open source software built and maintained by the Kirkhouse Trust. You can find a copy of the crosser source code on Git Hub.</p>
